# computer_filtering_script
I used this script in order to filter for specific computer names, last known users, and the last scan date if management were to ask for this information of multiple computers.  When I asked for this information on 30 computers, I was able to turn a 30min job into 3 minutes after downloading computer information from the company PDQ server.
